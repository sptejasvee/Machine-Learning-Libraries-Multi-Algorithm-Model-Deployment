Foundational Machine Learning Algorithms Project
A project focused on implementing core machine learning algorithms from scratch to gain a deep understanding of both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. This hands-on approach demonstrates how foundational models operate without relying on pre-built libraries.

Features

Supervised Learning Models:
Linear Regression
Polynomial Regression
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Unsupervised Learning Model:
K-Means Clustering
Neural Networks:

Implemented a basic neural network from scratch to understand forward and backward propagation.

Objective
Develop an in-depth understanding of machine learning by manually implementing algorithms for prediction, classification, and clustering tasks.
Gain experience in handling data preprocessing, feature scaling, and evaluation metrics.
